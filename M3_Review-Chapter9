Virtual Memory - Chapter 9

Virtual memory:
  \-> involves the separation of logical memory as perceived by users from physical memory.
  \-> Benefits:
    □ program would no longer be constrained by the amount of physical memory that is 
      available. Users would be able to write programs fro extremely large vertual addres 
      space, simplifuing the programming task.
    □ Because each user program could take less physical memory, more programs could be run at the same time, with
      corresponding increase in CPU utilization and throughput but with no increase in response time or turnaround time
    □ Less I/O would be needed to load or swap user programs into memory, so each user program would run faster
    □ benefiticial for both system and user
    □ faster swap in/out
    
  \-> virtual memory asslows files and memory to be shared by two or more processes through page sharing.

Virtual Address Space:11
  \-> refers to the logical (or virtual) view of how a process is stored in memory
    □ typically, this view is that a process begins at a certain logical address and exists in contiguous memory
  \-> address spaces that include holes are know as sparse address spaces.
    □ benificial because the holes can be filled as the stack or heap segments grow or if we wish to dynamically link 
      libraries during execution time
      
Demand Paging:
  \-> only load pages as they are needed during execution.
  \-> pages that are never accessed are never loaded into physical memory
