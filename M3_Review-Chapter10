Storage Management - Chapter 10

Slide: Mass Storage

  Magnetic Disk:
    □ provides the bulk of secondary storage for modern computer systems
    □ date rate:
      □ the rate at which data flows between the drive and the computer.
    □ Access Time:
      □ consists of two parts:
        1) seek time - the time necessary to move the disk arm to the desired cylinder 
        2) rotational latency - the time necessary for the desired sector to roate to the disk head
      □ Interface: ATA, SATA, SCSI, FC, etc
  
  Magnetic Tape:
    □ used mainly for backup
    
  Network Attached Storage (NAS)
    □ EG. file shares home directories...
  
  Storage Area Network
    □ block storage
  
  
  Disk Scheduling:
    □ First come first server:
      □ simplest scheduling
      □ not the fastest service
    
    □ SSTF Scheduling: (Shortest-seek-time-first)
      □ not optimal but better than FCFS
      □ reduces head movement
      □ starvation is a posibility
    
    □ SCAN scheduling: (elevator algorithm)
      □ The head continuously scans back and forth across the disk
    
    □ C-SCAN Scheduling: (circular scan)
      □ similar to SCAN scheduling except skips all reqeuest on its return trip to the beginning of disk
      □ fairness
    
    □ Look scheduling:
      □ looks for closest request and proceeds to it.
