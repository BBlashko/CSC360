/* CSC 360 - Assignment #1 - Part 1 */

1. How many threads are you going to use? Specify the work that you intend each thread to perform.

    Number of Threads = Number of Trains in the input file file + Controller Thread (Program Thread)
  
    Threads:
        \-> Train:
            \-> threads handles the loading of of the trains.
            \-> Waits for convar variable to tell it to go.
            \-> waits while crossing track
            \-> rel
            
            
        \-> Program Thread:
            \-> Initializes all the train threads when reading the input file.
                once a train thread is created tell the thread to wait until the Program Thread broadcasts a Condition
                Variable to signal all trains commence loading.
            \-> This thread will contain the while loop 
                
2.  Do the threads work independently? Or, is there an overall “controller” thread?
        \-> The train threads will work independently from each other. But the main program thread will control the 
            train queues and signal the loaded trains to cross the track.
            
3.  How many mutexes are you going to use? Specify the operation that each mutex will guard.
        \-> Number of mutexes = 
        \-> 

4.  Will the main thread be idle? If not, what will it be doing?
        \->

5.  How are you going to represent stations (which are collections of loaded trains ready to depart)? That is, what
    type of data structure will you use?
        \-> The program will use 2 queues one for low priority trains and one for high priority trains. The direction the 
            train is traveing is already known in the train threads.
            
6.  How are you going to ensure that data structures in your program will not be modified concurrently?

7.  How many convars are you going to use? For each convar:
        (a) Describe the condition that the convar will represent.
        (b) Which mutex is associated with the convar? Why?
        (c) What operation should be performed once pthread cond wait() has been unblocked and re-acquired the
            mutex?
            
        Convar 1: commence loading:
            \-> this convar is used to broadcast to all newly created train threads that they can start loading their cargo
        Convar 2: 
            
8.  In 15 lines or less, briefly sketch the overall algorithm you will use. You may use sentences such as:

        EG. If train is loaded, get station mutex, put into queue, release station mutex.
                


Procedure of the Program:

    1. Read input file for list of trains containing: 
        \-> id
        \-> direction of train
        \-> priority level (low/high)
        \-> loading time
        \-> crossing time
    1.1 tell trains to wait for convar to begin loading
    
        
    2. Signal all trains to load cargo  (broadcast condition variable)
        2.1 threads started on function: train_thread()
            \-> load train
            \-> queue and wait for convar to cross track
            \-> convar unblocks train.
            \-> train mutex locks the track
            \-> wait(crossing time)
            \-> unlock mutex variable track
            \-> reset convar
            \-> close thread
    
    3. 
    
    (1)     void init(){
                open file
                While(file has another train) {
                    create p_thread (in a list of threads)
    (1.1)           tell p_thread to wait until "start loading" convar is broadcasted.
                }
                close file
                for each train call pthread_join
            }
        
    (2.1)   int train_thread(){
                //load train
                //queue train
                //train crosses track
                //close train thread
            }
            
            int main(){
    (1)         init()
    (2)         broadcast("start loading" convar)
            
                while(pthreads exist){
                    //check queues for next train to cross track
                    
                    
                }
                return 0
            }
